= Introduction

These pages are meant as a quick reference for the python programming
language. All code here assumes you are using **python version 3**.
Use the *Table of Contents* on the left to select your topic of interest.

The python *shell* or *interpreter* is very useful for testing or trying
simple python statements. Any examples below that have a *triple-greater-than*
prompt (>>>) are showing output using the python shell, like this:

    >>> print("hello!")
    hello!

You can start the python shell by typing the `python3` command in a terminal
window (the dollar sign ($) is the terminal prompt, which you don't type):

    $ python3
    Python 3.6.7 (default, Oct 22 2018, 11:32:17) 
    [GCC 8.2.0] on linux
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> 

You can exit the python shell with Cntl-d (hold down the Control key, then
hit the 'd' key).
