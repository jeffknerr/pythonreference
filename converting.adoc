### converting between strings and lists

Often, in programs that manipulate strings,
you want to convert from a string to a list or
from a list to a string (due to lists
being mutable and strings being immutable).

To convert any string to a list of individual characters,
use the `list()` function:

    >>> S = "ABCDEFG"
    >>> L = list(S)
    >>> print(L)
    ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G']

Use the `split()` string method to *split* a string into substrings. The substrings
are returned as a list. If no argument is given, it will split on whitespace.
Using an argument, we can split on any substring:

    >>> S = "we love cs"
    # split on spaces
    >>> L = S.split()
    >>> print(L)
    ['we', 'love', 'cs']

    >>> S = "jeff:rich:sara:david"
    # split on colons
    >>> L = S.split(":")
    >>> print(L)
    ['jeff', 'rich', 'sara', 'david']

Use the `join()` string method to convert a list back to a string.
Here's a quick example:

    >>> print(L)
    ['jeff', 'rich', 'sara', 'david']
    >>> S = "".join(L)
    >>> print(S)
    jeffrichsaradavid
    >>> S = "XXXX".join(L)
    >>> print(S)
    jeffXXXXrichXXXXsaraXXXXdavid

Whatever string is used as the object ("" or "XXXX"), it is inserted
between each item in the list when making the new string.
