= Functions: advanced

Functions make your programs easier to read, write, design, debug, and
test. Once you understand how functions work, they will make your
programming life much much easier!

This section describes some important details about functions in python:

* scope/variables
* stack diagrams
* mutable objects in functions

== scope and variables

A variable's *scope* refers to where a variable is *valid*.
For example, in this program with two functions, `main()` and
`times2()`, the variable `factor` is **in scope** (i.e., valid)
only in `times2()`:

[source,python]
----
def main():
   x = 5
   result = times2(x)
   print("result: ", result)
   print("     x: ", x)

def times2(factor):
   factor = factor*2
   return factor

main()
----

If we added a `print(factor)` statement in `main()`, the program
would crash, since `factor` is not defined or valid in `main()`:

      print(factor)
    NameError: name 'factor' is not defined

Similarly, the variable `x` is only valid (in scope) in `main()`.
Trying to use `x` in `times2()` would also cause a runtime error.

Furthermore, it does not matter what the `factor` variable in `times2()`
is called! We *could* name it `x`, but that would be a *different* `x`
than the one defined in `main()`. 

Here's the code again, this time with the variable in `times2()`
defined as `x`:

[source,python]
----
def main():
   x = 5
   result = times2(x)
   print("result: ", result)
   print("     x: ", x)

def times2(x):
   x = x*2
   return x

main()
----

And here's the output from running that code:

    result:  10
         x:  5

Notice that the `x` printed in `main()`, *after* the `times2()` function
was called, still has the value 5 (even though the `x` in `times2()` was
set to 10).

== stack diagrams

You can easily see a variable's scope if you view the program's stack
diagram using the http://pythontutor.com[python tutor]. Here's an image
of the above code (with `x` in each function) running in the 
http://pythontutor.com[python tutor]:

image::scope-stack.png[]

On the right of that image are three *stack frames*: Global (which we
are ignoring), main, and times2. We have used the python tutor "Forward>"
button to step through the program, one statement at a time. First
`main()` was called, then `main()` called `times2()` on line 3, and we
are currently stopped at the end of `times2()` (line 9), about to
`return x`.

For the stack, each time a function is called, a new stack frame is
created and placed "on top" of the stack. All of that function's variables
are defined in that stack frame and have *local scope*. As you can see, there 
is an `x` in `main()` with value 5, and there is an `x` in `times2()`
with value 10. Even though we used the same name, **there are two
different `x` variables**. Each variable is *local in scope* to that
function. 

The stack is useful for seeing what variables are in scope, but also for
keeping track of where we are in the execution of the program. If
`main()` calls `functionA()` and `functionA()` calls `functionB()`,
the stack would look like this:

image::stack.png[]

In the http://pythontutor.com[python tutor] the stack is always
drawn increasing toward the bottom of the window, but it is more
useful to think of the stack as a stack of trays or dishes: the one
on top is the current tray/dish (the one you would grab). The function
on "top" of the stack is the one currently running. When that function
finishes and returns, control drops back to the function one "below"
on the stack.

This is how the "Back" button on your browser works, or the "Undo"
option in an editor works. All visited web pages (or editor changes) are
kept in a stack. The item on "top" of the stack is the current item.
For the browser, if you hit the "Back" button, the page on top of the
stack is removed and the browser goes back to the previous page (the
next page down in the stack).

== mutable objects

In python, mutable objects are *not* copied to local variables in
functions. Instead, they are passed to functions *by reference*.
This means, for example, if you send a python list to a function, and
in that function you change an item in the list, that change will be
visible back in `main()`:

[source,python]
----
def main():
  L = list("ABCD")
  print(L)
  change2(L)
  print(L)

def change2(mylist):
  mylist[2] = "pony"
  # note...no return statement needed

main()
----

Here's the result of running that program:

    $ python3 function-list.py
    ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
    ['A', 'B', 'pony', 'D']

You can again easily see this in the 
http://pythontutor.com[python tutor]:

image::mutable.png[]

See how both `L` in `main()` and `mylist` in `change2()` 
**both point to the same list data**! Both variables *refer*
back to the same list stored in the memory of the computer.
Assigning `mylist[2]` in `change2()` to some other value ("pony")
has the *side-effect* of also changing `L` in `main()`, since they both
refer back to the same list.

This feature is useful, but often confusing to first-time programmers.

It is useful, say, if you pass a 1-million-element list to a function.
If python made a copy of that list, it would take time and be
inefficient.

It is confusing because the function can change items in a list (or any
items in a mutable python object), and those changes are seen outside of
the function, and the function doesn't have to return anything. This is
exactly the opposite of what we talked about above, with variables in
functions and local scope.

Here's a simple example of using a function that modifies a list
without returning anything from the function:

    >>> from random import shuffle
    >>> L = list("ABCDEFG")
    >>> print(L)
    ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G']
    >>> shuffle(L)
    >>> print(L)
    ['E', 'B', 'F', 'C', 'A', 'G', 'D']
    >>> shuffle(L)
    >>> print(L)
    ['C', 'D', 'A', 'F', 'G', 'B', 'E']
